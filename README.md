This assistant has the following functionalities:-

  a)If your response is positive it will give you a positive feedback
  b)If your response is negative then you will recieve a consoling feedback
  c)If your response is neutral then you will recieve a neutral feedback

2)It can respond to you if you give some creepy text like (I Love You , I am falling for you etc)

3)It can search for almost anything you wish 
  a)It will try to get the results from wikipedia (a python module has been used)
  b)If it is not able to find it in the wikipedia it will by default search that in a newtab at google.com in the default browser

4)It can play your favourite song in youtube with commands like (Play ... song, can you play (song).... and many more (try experimenting ;)

5)It can give temprature data
  a)Of your locality
  b)Or any specific city or country

  b)In Flipkart ("Search X in flipkart","Can you search X in flipkart", Basically you just have to specify flipkart while speaking)

8)If you are feeling gloomy you can ask it to tell you a joke, it will. (May not be funnny though :/ )
